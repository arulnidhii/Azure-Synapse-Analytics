# Used various compute engines including Serverless SQL pool, Spark Pool, Dedicated SQL Pool, and Synapse Data Flows. Leveraged these capabilities to create and query via Serverless SQL Pool and Spark Pool, achieving data discovery, virtualization (with external tables/views), and transformation (with schema/partitions stored in Parquet format).
#	Successfully integrated various data storage and integration tools, Managed data integration with Synapse pipelines and incorporated dimensional data modeling by applying a star schema in the Serverless SQL pool to enhance data organization and query performance. Constructed robust pipelines and triggers, enabling flawless data ingestion and transformation, fortifying data integrity, and boosting pipeline performance by 40%.
#	Demonstrated proficiency in data visualization with Power BI, integrated with Synapse Studio for enhanced analytics. Utilized Synapse link for Cosmos DB to create an analytical store, querying data with spark pool and serverless SQL pool. Established a Dedicated SQL Pool to copy data from the data lake, enhancing data availability for analytic processes, and accelerating data retrieval times by 25%
